## Intro

This is a **maintained** fork of the fruition-parteners filesync repo. This repository adds support for current versions of ServiceNow, cleans up code managment (to allow more contribution!) and provides further solutions to common "editing in ServiceNow environment" issues (eg, conflict saves). See the **Road Map** below for more info. **Contributors wanted!**


## Overview

FileSync synchronises ServiceNow instance field values to local files and syncs file changes back to the applicable record.

This enables ServiceNow developers to use their favourite integrated development environments (IDEs) and text editors
like WebStorm, Sublime and [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) for editing JavaScript, HTML, Jelly and other code - without wasting time and interrupting
development workflow copying and pasting code into a browser.

When a file changes within a configured root (project) folder, the parent folder and file name are used to identify the
table and record to be updated.

Adding an empty file, or clearing and saving an existing file, refreshes the local file with the latest instance
version, syncing *from* the instance *to* the local file. This is an easy way to populate your project folder with
existing scripts related to your project.

Conflict management also detects if the server version has changed before trying to upload local changes (that may be based on an outdated version).


## Quick Start

**[Download the repository](https://github.com/dynamicdan/filesync/archive/master.zip)** and check out the **[intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlVllfPVOrA)** that explains the concept and starting points.

The original video for installing, configuring and using FileSync for v.0.1.0 can be found [here](https://vimeo.com/76383815).

Configure the app.config.js file as required per **[app.config.json settings](#appconfigjson-settings)** below. Run the Windows (filesync.bat) or Mac (filesync.command) based app launcher.

### Installation

**Step 1.** Ensure that your instance is running with a version greater or equal to Eureka to make use of the JSONv2 API (enabled by default). For versions prior to Eurkea use the [older version of FileSync](https://github.com/fruition-partners/filesync).

**Step 2.** Create a folder on your computer where the records will be saved.

**Step 3.** Edit **app.config.json**.

* Review the **app.config.json settings** section below for guidance. **Please read all comments.**
* Configure at least one root (project) folder including the host, user and pass. **"user"** and **"pass"** will be encoded and replaced
by an **"auth"** key at runtime.
* **Note:** You must restart FileSync any time you update app.config.json.

## Usage

With installation and configuration completed, you can start **filesync** by executing the included batch/shell scripts:

* Windows: double-click: **filesync.bat**
* Mac: right-click on **filesync.command** and choose Open (OS X first run security). Future use can simply double-click to open.

This launches a console window where you should see log messages showing the starting configuration of FileSync.  Do not
close this window.  This is what is watching for file changes.  As you make changes to mapped files, you'll see messages
logged showing the sync processing.

If you are using the default config then you will already have all the appropraite folders created for you and some test script include files that will have been downloaded from the instance. See "preLoad" and "createAllFolders" options below.

Additionally, you can sync more files by adding an empty file corresponding to an instance record.  You can do this from your editor
or IDE, or via the command line:

On Windows, at a command prompt:

    cd c:\dev\project_a
    md script_includes
    cd script_includes
    copy nul JSUtil.js      <-- creates an empty file named JSUtil.js

On Mac, in Terminal:

    cd /path/to/project_a
    mkdir script_includes
    cd script_includes
    touch JSUtil.js         <-- creates an empty file named JSUtil.js

Adding the empty JSUtil.js file will cause FileSync to sync the (OOB) JSUtil script include to the file. Any changes to
this local file will now be synced to the mapped instance.

The basic workflow is to initially create a script on ServiceNow (script include, business rule, ui script, etc.), then
add an empty file of the same name (and mapped extension) to a mapped local folder.

FileSync does not currently support creating new records in ServiceNow by simply adding local files since there are
additional fields that may need to be populated beyond mapped script fields. So, always start by creating a new
record on the instance, then add the empty local file and start editing your script.

### app.config.json settings

*Comments are included below for documentation purposes but are not valid in JSON files. You can validate JSON at
<http://www.jslint.com/>*

app.config.json file sample (see also app/app.config.json):

```javascript
    {
        // maps a root (project) folder to an instance
        "roots": {
            "c:/dev/project_a": {                   // full path to root folder
                                                    // on Windows, ensure that forward slashes are used!
                "host": "demo001.service-now.com",  // instance host name
                "user": "admin",                    // instance credentials
                "pass": "admin"                     // encoded to auth key and re-saved at runtime
            },
            "c:/dev/project_b": {                 // add additional root mappings as needed
                "host": "demo002.service-now.com",
                "auth": "YWRtaW46YWRtaW4="          // example of encoded user/pass
            },
            "/Users/joe.developer/instance/records": { // mac os non-https example
                "host": "some.instance.com:16001",
                "protocol": "http",                    // if https is not supported then force http here
                "auth": "YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=",
                "preLoadList": {
                    "script_includes": ["JSUtil.js",
                                        "Transform.js"] // specify a list of files to create and sync on
                                                        //   startup (see preLoad below)
                }
            }
        },

        "preLoad": true,                            // create files as defined above per root in "preLoad"
        "createAllFolders": true,                   // create local folders to save on manual effort

        "debug": false                              // set to true to enable more detailed debug logging

    }
```

### Folder definitions (optional)

See the **src/records.config.json** file for sample definitions.

```javascript
        "roots" { .... },

        // maps a subfolder of a root folder to a table on the configured instance
        "folders": {
            "script_includes": {                    // folder with files to sync
                "table": "sys_script_include",      // table with records to sync to
                "key": "name",                      // field to match with filename to ID unique record
                "fields": {                         // file contents are synced to a field based on filename suffix
                    "js": "script"                  //   files ending in .js will sync to script field
                }
            },
            "business_rules": {
                "table": "sys_script",
                "key": "name",
                "fields": {
                    "js": "script"
                }
            },
            "ui_pages": {
                "table": "sys_ui_page",
                "key": "name",
                "fields": {                          // multiple fields for the same record can be mapped to multiple
                    "xhtml": "html",                 //   files by using different filename suffixes
                    "client.js": "client_script",    //   for ui pages, you might have three separate files:
                    "server.js": "processing_script" //    mypage.xhtml, mypage.client.js, mypage.server.js
                }                                    //   to store the all script associated with the page
            }
            ...
        },
```

### Command Line Usage

To get a list of options and their usage run the following command:
````
./node-darwin src/app --help
 OR
node.exe src/app --help
````




## Advanced settings

Property | Values | Default | Purpose
------------ | -------------------- | ------------- | -------------
debug | Bool: true / false | false | Enable more verbose debugging. Useful to troubleshoot connection issues.
ignoreDefaultFolders | Bool: true / false | false | If false then utilise record to folder mapping defined in **src/records.config.json**.<br />If true then the **"folders"** property must be set as described below.
folders | Object listing folders | not set (inherited) | See **src/records.config.json** as an example for format and usage. If this property is defined then it will override that defined in **src/records.config.json** on a per folder level. This is an easy way to specify more mappings without modifying core files. If "ignoreDefaultFolders " is set to true then **src/records.config.json** is completely ignored and all mappings must be defined in the "folders" property.
createAllFolders | Bool: true / false | false | Creates all folders specified by folders (if set) or the default **src/records.config.json** file.
preLoad | Bool: true / false | false | Creates local files that can be specified per root setting "`preLoadList`" (defined below). Set to false to ignore the property. Note that files that already exist are ignored but there is however a slight performance cost if you leave this option set to true. <br />**TIP**: set to false once files have been created.
ignoreList | Array of matches | `["**/.*"]` | Define what files are not tracked for changes. Defaults to ignore hidden files on any directory level (eg `.sync_data`).
ensureUniqueNames | Bool: true / false | false | If set to true then files will be postfixed with the record sys_id to ensure all saved files have unique names. This supports records for the same table with the same name. By default this is false to encourage more useful record names.


#### Root specific options

Use on the same level where host is defined.

Property | Values | Default | Purpose
------------ | -------------------- | ------------- | -------------
preLoadList | Object listing folders and files | n/a |  Defines a list of files to automatically download per folder. Saves on manual file creation efforts <br />Eg: <br />``` preLoadList: { ```<br />  ```  "business_rules": ["my special rule.js", "Another rule.js"]```<br />```}```
protocol | "http" | https | If https is not supported then force http usage
acceptBadSSL | Bool: true / false | false | If the SSL is not fully valid or is sefl-signed or the signing authority is not valid then set this to true. This should only be set to true in development environments. Setting debug to true will help test connection issues and will help validate if this is an issue or not.


### Specifying a config file

Config files can be specified when running the app via the command line.
* Eg. ```./node-darwin src/app --config ~/Desktop/my-instance.config.json```

When not running the app via the command line the default app.config.json file will be used.
If you require added security, it is suggested to create an invisible folder that contains your config files.
* Eg. mac: `~/.filesync/toyota.config.json`
* Eg. win: `c:/<HOME DIR>/.filesync/ford.config.json`


### Exporting current setup

It is a burden to download the various records in the correct folders when getting started. To alleviate this there is an export function that will generate a config file with the `preLoadList` filled in.

This is also useful if you want to create a backup of your current setup.

Command Line Usage:

````
./node-darwin src/app --config <config to use> --export <new config file>
````

Eg.
````
./node-darwin src/app --config ~/.filesync/app.config-acme.json --export ~/Desktop/acme.config.json
````

The resulting json file will **not** include your authentication information. It will include the folder setup you used and a preLoadList listing all the records you have previously downloaded. This is very handy for getting new team members setup and providing them an easy reference to important files. Eg, for CMS development this could mean theme CSS/SASS, UI Macros, UI Pages and various script includes.


### SASS CSS pre-compiler support

It is possible to use FileSync with [compass](http://compass-style.org/) or [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) to generate your CSS for CMS theme development. To do this we specify a folder definition in your config file like so:

```
"folders": {
        "theme_sass": {
            "table": "content_css",
            "key": "name",
            "fields": {
                "scss": "style"
            }
        }
    },
```

Your file hierarchy would then look like this:

```
/project/records/style_sheets/base.css
/project/records/style_sheets/service_catalog.css

/project/records/theme_sass/_vars.scss
/project/records/theme_sass/base.scss
/project/records/theme_sass/service_catalog.scss
/project/records/theme_sass/_ootb_service_catalog.scss

/project/compass/config.rb
/project/compass/.sass-cache/
```

In this setup "theme_sass" holds your scss files/records including partials named on the instance like "base_scss" and "_vars_scss". The **"_scss"** part is important both from a FileSync technical perspective and for your successor or future maintainer. If your sass files do not use the **".scss"** suffix and your records do not contain **"_scss"** at the end then the sync process won't work.

Your config.rb file is then configured to output the css generated files to the "style_sheets" folder. The config.rb file would then be configured like this:

```
css_dir = "../records/style_sheets"
sass_dir = "../records/theme_sass"
```

On the instance you then simply create 2 themes. One that is used by your CMS (where "style_sheets" are uploaded to) and another that is used for development (where "theme_sass" SCSS files are uploaded). We start watching for SASS changes using the command: "`compass watch /project/compass`" and when compass outputs the new files they will be detected by FileSync and uploaded (including the SCSS files that have changed).

Using this setup ensures that the customer will have all the files needed to do further development in case they want to use SASS or plain CSS files. If another developer wanted to work on the theme but didn't have compass/SASS configured then they could use an extra CSS record/file.

## Search and Download

### Search Overview

The search feature supports 3 activites:
 1. **Demo** mode to test out the tool and your connection.
 1. **Custom search** that works with sysparm_query and your desired table(s) to search for records. Note that by default all tables defined under the ```folders``` config are searched if the ```table``` option is not provided.
 1. **Download** option. Set to true when the search results match what you want in order to start syncing. When false or not set the search system displays found results but will not save the records to files.

Additionally it's possible to set the max amount of records returned per search (instance default is normally 10,000) and specify a specific table to search on (so long as it's mapped in your *folders* config).

### Search Usage

The search component enforces using the config file instead of the command line to define the search criteria. This helps by saving commonly used search settings. Below is a sample configuration that also exists in the default config file. Note that the query used is exactly the same as the **sysparm_query** used when filtering list views or when working with **encoded queries**.

```javascript

    "roots": { ... },
    "search": {
        "mine": {
            "query": "sys_updated_by=admin",
            "records_per_search": "3",
            "download": true
        },
        "team": {
            "query": "sys_created_on>javascript:gs.dateGenerate('2015-03-25','23:59:59')^sys_created_by!=javascript:gs.getUserName()^sys_updated_by!=javascript:gs.getUserName()^sys_created_by!=admin^ORDERBYDESCsys_updated_on",
            "records_per_search": "100",
        },
        "script-includes": {
            "table": "sys_script_include", // limit to just one table
            "query": "sys_created_on>javascript:gs.dateGenerate('2015-03-25','23:59:59')",
            "records_per_search": "1",
            "download": true // download all founds results
        }
    },

```

### Search Command Line Usage

 * Test the search system in demo mode:
 ```
 ./node-darwin src/app --config ~/my-conf.json --search
 ```
 * Search based on a pre-defined search config (defined in *my-conf.json*):
 ```
 ./node-darwin src/app --config ~/my-conf.json --search mine
 ```
 * Download records found via search (overwrites existing local files if they exist):
```
./node-darwin src/app --config ~/my-conf.json --search mine --download
```

Note that the defaults are to search in demo mode without downloading any records.

### Tips for Searching

Search unlocks a great deal of potential. Here are some ideas showing how you can benefit from using search.

* No need to create your files anymore. Simply always use search to download all files created or updated by you.
* Bulk updates? Simply download all the records created since instance development started and use your favourite editor to bulk search and replace. 1000 records could take seconds compared to the hours via the instance interface.
* Look for bad practice. Search across all tables of interest for scripts that don't use best practice naming conventions.
 * Run your own health report. Download all fields of interest and then run your own RegEx queries to look for configuration issues.
* Quickly and easily take over from a colleague. If they are going on holiday then just download the records they worked on recently and not worry about them forgetting to tell you where the important stuff is!
* Export all description content or story content or ANY attribute from any table in bulk. Could identify documentation issues.
 * Export entire records but only the fields of interest. Eg, description field, script field, last modification date etc.


## Road Map

Considering ServiceNow does not handle merge conflicts at all, this is a major goal of this tool! Contributions to help achieve this road map or improve the tool in general are **greatly** appreciated.

- [x] support latest versions (Eurkea+) of ServiceNow
- [x] add protocol support to use http:// for on-premise setups
- [x] check if the record has been updated on the server before uploading changes and warn the user and cancel the upload (basic conflict management)
- [x] add notification (mac OS) to signify that the upload is complete (or failed)
- [x] ignore hidden files better (Eg. ".DS_Store", ".jshintrc")
- [ ] when an update conflict has been detected write out the remote file and launch a diff app (command line "diff" or mac OS XCode "FileMerge" via "`opendiff <left> <right>`") for the user to help resolve the differences
- [ ] allow upload override of server record if the user has made a merge of remote and local data

- [ ] upgrade node binaries to latest versions (currently version "v0.8.25". version here http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.37/ needs testing with restify)
- [x] upgrade 3rd party node_modules (except restify)
- [ ] upgrade restify or find alternative that works better (restify is at "2.6.0" but should be "3.0.1" which needs "node": ">=0.10" run `npm outdated` for details)
- [x] use standard npm package.json setup to specify 3rd part node_modules




Nice to haves
- [x] auto create folder structure for user (```./node-darwin src/app --setup```)
- [x] add record browser to automatically download chosen files (via ```--search``` option)
- [x] option to re-download all files from instance (```./node-darwin src/app --resync```)
- [x] auto download records created or updated by a given user ID (via ```--search``` option)
- [x] notifications are clickable and load the record in the browser
- [ ] offline support? (keep track of files that are queued to upload when the connection is available again and retry).. maybe not. This could be dangerous if records get updated without someone to test them. Potentially workable if the last queued file is less than 3 minutes ago to cater for flaky mobile/roaming connections.
- [x] save meta data received in request for user info (eg, sys_updated_on, sys_updated_by, sys_mod_count, description) (currently viewable in the `.sync_data/` files)
- [ ] config option to log details to log file (help others send log info)
- [x] download records on startup provided by a list (See ```"preLoad"``` in app.config.json)
- [x] add windows support for fancy/OS style notifications
